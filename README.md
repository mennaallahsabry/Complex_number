# Complex_number
Problem solving 
Two complex numbers, and yprint the result of 
their addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulus operations. 
The real and imaginary precision part should be correct up to two decimal places. 

Input format:
One line of input: The real and imaginary part of a number separated by a space. 

Output format:
For two complex numbers C and D, the output should be in the following sequence on 
separate lines:
● C + D 
● C - D 
● C * D 
● C / D 
● mod(C) 
● mod(D) 

–For complex numbers with non-zero real(A) and complex part(B), the output 
should be in the following format: A + Bi 
Replace the plus symbol (+) with a minus symbol (-) when B < 0.

-For complex numbers with a zero complex part i.e., real numbers, 
the output should be A+0.00i 

-For complex numbers where the real part is zero and the complex part(B) is nonzero, the output should be: 0.00+Bi
